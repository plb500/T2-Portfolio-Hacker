A project born out of insanity and obsession.

When I was a kid I was obsessed with the little computer John Connor had in T2. 

I decided to make a "working" prop replica - something that would actually use the Atari Portoflio to "hack" a locked container. This is that.

There is MUCH more to this story. Getting a replica of the credit card is a whole story in itself, but I don't have the energy to document all this right now
